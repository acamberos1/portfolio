    <p>Originating from Arizona I didn't have an idea of what career to pursue when I set out into the work field. After taking on a few different jobs I thought that the best path would be to get a degree in college and learn the fundamentals coding. I succesfully got a degree in Informatics, and attended a coding camp called Learn Academy for hands on experience for coding. Now I reside in San Diego looking for an opportunity to find employment in web development, and become proficient in front and back end development.</p>
